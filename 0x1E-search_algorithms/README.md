<h1>Search Algorithms</h1>
<h2>Linear Search</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Linear search, also known as sequential search, involves scanning through each element in a data structure (usually an array or list) one by one until the target element is found or the entire data structure is exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
       Time Complexity:O(n) in the worst case, where 'n' is the number of elements.
      Binary Search
         Description: Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted data. It repeatedly divides the search space in half and compares the middle element with the target value.
      Time Complexity: O(log n) in the worst case, where 'n' is the number of elements.
    </p>
    <h2>Hashing
    </h2>
    <h3>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h3>
    <p>
    
Description: Hashing is a technique that uses a hash function to map keys or values to an index in an array, allowing for efficient retrieval and storage of data.
   
<strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(1) on average, but it can degrade to O(n) in the worst case if there are many collisions.
